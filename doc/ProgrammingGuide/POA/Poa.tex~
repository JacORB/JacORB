\chapter{The server side: POA, Threads}
\label{ch:POA}

This  chapter   describes  the   facilities  offered  by   JacORB  for
controlling  how servers are  started and  executed. These  include an
activation daemon, the Portable Object Adapter (POA), and threading.

This chapter gives only a very superficial introduction to the POA.  A
thorough explanation of how the POA can be used in different settings and of
the different policies and strategies it offers is beyond our scope here, but
can be found in \cite{Brose2001a}.  Other references that explain the POA are
\cite{Henning1999, Vinoski1998}.  More in--depth treatment in C++ can be found
in the various C++-Report Columns on the POA by Doug Schmidt and Steve
Vinoski.  These articles are available at
\href{http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/report-doc.html}{http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/report-doc.html}.
The ultimate reference, of course, is the CORBA specification.

\section{POA}

The POA provides a comprehensive set of interfaces for managing object
references and servants. The code  written using the POA interfaces is
now portable across ORB implementations  and has the same semantics in
every ORB that is compliant to CORBA 2.2 or above.

The POA defines standard interfaces to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Map an object reference to a servant that implements that object
\item Allow transparent activation of objects
\item Associate policy information with objects
\item  Make a  CORBA  object persistent  over  several server  process
lifetimes
\end{itemize}

In the POA specification, the use of pseudo-IDL has been deprecated in
favor  of an approach  that uses  ordinary IDL,  which is  mapped into
programming languages using the  standard language mappings, but which
is  locality constrained.  This means  that references  to  objects of
these types may not be passed outside of a server's address space. The
POA  interface  itself  is  one  example of  a  locality--constrained
interface.

The  object adapter  is that  part of  CORBA that  is  responsible for
creating CORBA  objects and  object references and  --- with  a little
help  from  skeletons ---  dispatching  operation  requests to  actual
object  implementations.   In  cooperation  with   the  Implementation
Repository  it can also  activate objects,  i.e. start  processes with
programs that provide implementations for CORBA objects.

\section{Threads}

JacORB  currently  offers  one   server--side  thread  model.  The  POA
responsible for a given request will obtain a request processor thread
from  a central  thread pool.  The pool  has a  certain size  which is
always between the maximum and  minimum value configure by setting the
properties     {\tt     jacorb.poa.thread\_pool\_max}     and     {\tt
jacorb.poa.thread\_pool\_min}.

When a  request arrives and  the pool is  found to contain  no threads
because all  existing threads are  active, new threads may  be started
until     the    total    number     of    threads     reaches    {\tt
jacorb.poa.thread\_pool\_max}. Otherwise,  request processing is blocked
until a  thread is returned to  the pool. Upon  returning threads that
have  finished processing a  request to  the pool,  it must  be decided
whether  the  thread  should  actually   remain  in  the  pool  or  be
destroyed. If the current pool  size is above the minimum, a processor
thread will not be out into the pool again. Thus, the pool size always
oscillates between max and min.

Setting {\tt min} to a value  greater than one means keeping a certain
number  of   threads  ready  to  service   incoming  requests  without
delay. This is  especially useful if you now  that requests are likely
to come  in in a bursty fashion.  Limiting the pool size  to a certain
maximum  is  done to  prevent  servers  from  occupying all  available
resources.

Request  processor   threads  usually   run  at  the   highest  thread
priority. It is possible to influence thread priorities by setting the
property  {\tt jacorb.poa.thread\_priority} to  a value  between Java's
Thread.MIN\_PRIORITY and Thread.MAX\_PRIORITY. If the configured priority
value  is  invalid JacORB  will  assign  maximum  priority to  request
processing threads.
