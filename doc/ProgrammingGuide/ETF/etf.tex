The \emph{Extensible Transport Framework (ETF)}, which JacORB
implements, allows you to plug in other transport layers besides the
 standard IIOP (TCP/IP) protocol\footnote{At the time of
 this writing (July 2003), ETF is still a draft standard (OMG TC
 document mars/2003-02-01).}.

To use an alternative transport, you need to (a) implement it as a set
of Java classes following the ETF specification, and (b) tell JacORB
to use the new transport instead of (or alongside with) the standard
IIOP transport.  We cover both steps below.

\section{Implementing a new Transport}

The interfaces that an ETF-compliant transport must implement are
 described in the ETF specification, and there is thus no need to
 repeat that information here.  JacORB's default IIOP transport, which
 is realized in the package {\tt org.jacorb.orb.iiop}, can also serve
 as a starting point for implementing your own transports.

For each transport, the following interfaces must be implemented
(defined in {\tt ETF.idl}, the package is {\tt org.omg.ETF}):

\begin{description}
\item[Profile] encapsulates addressing information for this transport
\item[Listener] server-side communication endpoint, waits for incoming
connections and passes them up to the ORB
\item[Connection] an actual communication channel for this transport
\item[Factories] contains factory methods for the above interfaces
\end{description}

The {\tt Handle} interface from the ETF package is implemented in the
 ORB (by the class {\tt org.jacorb.orb.BasicAdapter}), not by
 individual transports.  There is currently no support in JacORB for
 the optional zero-copy mechanism; the interface {\tt
 ConnectionZeroCopy} therefore needn't be implemented.

On the server side, the {\tt Listener} must pass incoming connections
 up to the ORB using the ``Handle'' mechanism; the {\tt accept()}
 method needn't be implemented.  Once a {\tt Connection} has been
 passed up to the ORB, it will never be ``returned'' to the {\tt
 Listener} again.  The method {\tt completed\_data()} in the {\tt
 Listener} interface therefore needn't be implemented, and neither
 should the {\tt Listener} ever call {\tt
 Handle.signal\_data\_available()} or {\tt Handle.closed\_by\_peer()}
 (these methods throw a {\tt NO\_IMPLEMENT} exception in JacORB).

At the time of this writing (July 2003), there is still uncertainty in
 ETF about how server-specific Profiles (as returned by {\tt
 Listener.endpoint()}, for example) should be turned into
 object-specific ones for inclusion into IORs.  We have currently
 added three new operations to the {\tt Profile} interface to resolve
 this issue, see JacORB's version of {\tt ETF.idl} for details.

\section{Configuring Transport Usage}

You tell JacORB which transports it should use by listing the names of
 their {\tt Factories} classes in the property {\tt
 jacorb.transport.factories}.  In the standard configuration, this
 property contains only {\tt org.jacorb.orb.iiop.IIOPFactories}, the
 {\tt Factories} class for the standard IIOP transport.  The
 property's value is a comma-separated list of fully qualified Java
 class names; each of these classes must be found somewhere on the
 CLASSPATH that JacORB is started with.  For example:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
jacorb.transport.factories = my.transport.Factories, org.jacorb.orb.iiop.IIOPFactories
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

By default, a JacORB server creates listeners for each transport
listed in the above property, and publishes profiles for each of these
transports in any IOR it creates.  The order of profiles within an IOR
is the same as that of the transports in the property.

If you don't want your servers to listen on each of these transports
 (e.g. because you want some of your transports only to be used for
 client-side connections), you can specify the set of actual listeners
 in the property {\tt jacorb.transport.server.listeners}.  The value
 of this property is a comma-separated list of numeric profile tags,
 one for each transport that you want listeners for, and which you
 want published in IOR profiles.  The numeric value of a transport's
 profile tag is the value returned by the implementation of {\tt
 Factories.profile\_tag()} for that transport.  Standard IIOP has
 profile tag 0 ({\tt TAG\_INTERNET\_IOP}).  Naturally, you can only
 specify profile tag numbers here for which you have a corresponding
 entry in {\tt jacorb.transport.factories}.

So, to restrict your server-side transports to standard IIOP, you
would write:

\begin{verbatim}
jacorb.transport.server.listeners = 0
\end{verbatim}

On the client side, the ORB must decide which of potentially many
 transports it should use to contact a given server.  The default
 strategy is that for each IOR, the client selects \emph{the first profile
 for which there is a transport implementation available at the client
 side} (specified in {\tt jacorb.transport.factories}).  Profiles for
which the client has no transport implementation are skipped.

Note that this is a purely static decision, based on availability of
 an implementation.  JacORB does not attempt to actually establish a
 transport connection in order to find out which transport can be
 used.  Also, should the selected transport fail, JacORB does not
 ``fall back'' to the next transport in the list.  (This is because
 JacORB opens connections lazily, only when the first actual data is
 being sent.)

You can customize this strategy by providing your own implementation of
{\tt org.jacorb.orb.ProfileSelector}, and specifying it in the
property {\tt jacorb.transport.client.selector}.  The interface {\tt
ProfileSelector} requires a single method,

\begin{verbatim}
   public Profile selectProfile (List profiles,
                                 ClientConnectionManager ccm);
\end{verbatim}

For each IOR, this method receives a list of all profiles from the IOR
 for which the client has a transport implementation, in the order in
 which they appear in the IOR.  The method should select one profile
 from this list and return it; this profile will then be used for
 communication with the server.

To help with the decision, JacORB's {\tt ClientConnectionManager} is
 passed as an additional parameter.  The method implementation can use
 it to check whether connections with a given transport, or to a given
 server, have already been made; it can also try and pre-establish a
 connection using a given transport and store it in the {\tt
 ClientConnectionManager} for later use.  (See the JacORB source code
to find out how to deal with the {\tt ClientConnectionManager}.)

The default {\tt ProfileSelector} does not use the {\tt
 ClientConnectionManager}, it simply returns the first profile from
 the list, unconditionally.  To let JacORB use your own implementation
 of the {\tt ProfileSelector} interface, specify the fully qualified
 classname in the property:

\begin{verbatim}
jacorb.transport.client.selector=my.pkg.MyProfileSelector
\end{verbatim}

\section{Selecting Specific Profiles Using RT Policies}
JacORB has a implementation of the standard Real Time CORBA ClientProtocolPolicy
policy which it uses to allow a developer to select between IIOP profiles that
either support or do not support an SSL component. When applied to a bind
(implicit or explicit), the ClientProtocolPolicy indicates the protocols that
 may be used to make a connection to the specified object.

The only non-standard proprietary component of this is the definition of two profile
IDs that are used to distinguish between IIOP/SSL, IIOP/NOSSL and IIOP profiles. The
three {\tt org.omg.RTCORBA.Protocol} types are:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt JAC\_SSL\_PROFILE\_ID}
\item {\tt NOSSL\_PROFILE\_ID}
\item {\tt org.omg.IOP.TAG\_INTERNET\_IOP}
\end {itemize}

The former two are defined within {\tt org.jacorb.orb.ORBConstants}. To apply
this the developer may use, for example, a ClientRequestInterceptor that applies
the policy to the object and throws a ForwardRequest, or may simply apply the
policy to the object as shown below.

\begin{samepage}
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}

   org.omg.RTCORBA.Protocol protocol = new org.omg.RTCORBA.Protocol();
   org.omg.RTCORBA.Protocol protocols[] = new org.omg.RTCORBA.Protocol[1];
   org.omg.CORBA.Policy policies[] = new org.omg.CORBA.Policy[1];

   protocol.protocol_type = ORBConstants.JAC_SSL_PROFILE_ID;
   protocols[0] = protocol;

   rtorb = org.omg.RTCORBA.RTORBHelper.narrow
                (orb.resolve_initial_references ("RTORB"));

   org.omg.RTCORBA.ClientProtocolPolicy cpp =
                rtorb.create_client_protocol_policy (protocols);

   policies[0] = cpp;

   <mycorbaobject-two> = MyCorbaObjectHelper.narrow (<mycorbaobject>._set_policy_override
                (policies, SetOverrideType.SET_OVERRIDE)_;
   <mycorbaobject>._release();
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
\end{samepage}
