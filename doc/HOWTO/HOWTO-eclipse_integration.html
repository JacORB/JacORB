    <H1>JacORB - Eclipse Integration mini HOW-TO</H1>
<p>
This document describes how to set up a project in eclipse to step
through, debug, or browse the source of JacORB.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>A dependency of this HOWTO is the prior
		installation of Ant, and the setting of the ANT_HOME
		environment variable. Don't open eclipse yet.</li>
		<li>Download and unpack the desired version of
		JacORB. For purposes of this document, I have unpacked
		JacORB into C:\jacorb_2_2_1.</li>
		<li>Set your JACORB_HOME environment variable.
			<pre>
				set JACORB_HOME=C:\jacorb_2_2_1
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>From the JACORB_HOME directory, execute ant.</li>
		<li>Once ant has completed successfully, open
		eclipse.</li>
		<li>Create a new Java project, and use JACORB_HOME as
		the project's root.</li>
		<li>In the Java Build Path screen, either while
		setting up the project or by going into the project
		properties after creating the project, you must
		include the following source directories:
			<ul>
				<li>JACORB_HOME/src</li>
				<li>JACORB_HOME/src/generated</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Now you must exclude certain other directories (we
                  will exclude those parts of JacORB that do not build
                  cleanly under eclipse in this simple
                  setup. Depending on your needs, you may want to
                  include some of them and work through their
                  dependencies yourself).  Double click on "Excluded
                  ..." beneath JACORB_HOME/src. Exclude the following
                  directories:

			<ul>
				<li>generated</li>
				<li>HTTPClient</li>
				<li>omg-02-01-02</li>
				<li>org/jacorb/notification</li>
				<li>org/jacorb/orb/http</li>
				<li>org/jacorb/security/level2</li>
				<li>org/jacorb/ssl</li>
				<li>org/jacorb/util</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Add the required jar files on the build
		path/Libraries window. These are all located in the
		JACORB_HOME/lib directory, plus ant.jar from your ant
		distribution.</li>
		<li>Let eclipse build the project.</li>
	</ul>

Thanks to Andre Spiegel for showing me how to do this.
