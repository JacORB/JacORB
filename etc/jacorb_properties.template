# JacORB writes logging information through SLF4J, which passes it to an
# arbitrary external logging system, by default JDK logging.  JacORB does
# not usually attempt to configure the logging system, that is left to the
# user.  The two properties below are retained from previous JacORB versions
# however.  If any of these properties is defined, and JDK logging is in
# use, then JacORB configures it according to these properties.
# For more sophisticated configurations, unset these properties and
# see the file logging_properties.template.

# log levels:
#
# 0 = no logging (OFF)
# 1 = errors (SEVERE)
# 2 = warnings (WARNING)
# 3 = informational messages (INFO)
# 4 = debug-level output (FINE)
#jacorb.log.default.verbosity=3

# If logging to file whether to append to existing file or overwrite
#jacorb.logfile.append=off

#jacorb.logfile.maxLogSize=0

# Number of logfiles to use.
#jacorb.logfile.rotateCount=1

# Where does output go? Terminal is default. If the filename includes
# "$implname", that is replaced with the value of jacorb.implname, if

#jacorb.connection.client.timeout_ignores_pending_messages=off

# whenever a network failure is detected, the orb can either
