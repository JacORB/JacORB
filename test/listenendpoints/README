  Endpoint Tests
  ===============================

This directory holds the integration test suite that is used for checking out
the endpoints.  There test directories are:
   - echo, which contains a simple echo server/client test,
   - echo_corbaloc, which contains an expanded echo test.

Please note that these tests are used by the integration test suites in the
directory test/orbreinvoke, so they will be built from there.

Building the Test Suites
-----------------------

Each test directory contains a build.xml file, so to build the tests, you first
need to set the environment variable JACORB_HOME, then go into the targeted
test directory and type:

  ant all

This should compile the IDL and Java code that is needed to run the test.
