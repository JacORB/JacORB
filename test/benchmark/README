Objective:
    A simple benchmark for remote invocations. It takes the system clock right
    before and after method invocations. Can choose simple ping, transfer of 
    array of ints, or transfer of array of structs, plus size of structs and 
    number of loops.
    
    There is also a simple example for local invocations using ColocatedServer
