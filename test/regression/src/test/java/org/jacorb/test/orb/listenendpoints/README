This is the regression test to checkout the -ORBListenEndpoints commandline options.
It uses the classes under the directory test/listenendpoints/echo_corbaloc.

The test performs the following tasks:
   - Initiates the test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Server with two wildcard listen endpoints.
   - Ensures those endpoints are reachable using all listenable hosts/IPs and correct service ports.
   - Ensures those endpoints are not reachable on a wrong port.

TBD: Make this test works with a remote server.
