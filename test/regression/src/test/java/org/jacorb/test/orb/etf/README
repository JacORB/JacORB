This is the ETF regression suite.  It defines its own testing transport,
WIOP, which is a wrapper around the standard IIOP transport.  To the ORB,
it looks like a totally different transport.

The individual test cases use both IIOP and WIOP in different configurations,
both on the client and on the server.
