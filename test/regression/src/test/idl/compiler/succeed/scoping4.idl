/**
 * Scoping test. I want to see if the compiler allows

 * whether it requires the use of s_Thing. Both should
 * be permissible. 
 * RESULT: Neither sequence definition is passed. Instead, a 
 *         run-time exception is raised by the JacORB compiler. 
 *         OPENORB compiler permits these.
