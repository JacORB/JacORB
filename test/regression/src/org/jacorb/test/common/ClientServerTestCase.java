/**
 * A special <code>TestCase</code> that provides access to a 
 * <code>ClientServerSetup</code>.  For information how to wrap
 * a <code>ClientServerSetup</code> around a suite of 
 * <code>ClientServerTestCase</code>s, see the class comment of
 * {@link ClientServerSetup}.
 * <p>
 * Each individual test case can access the server object by calling
 * <code>setup.getServerObject()</code>.  However, this returns
 * a generic CORBA Object.  It is usually more convenient to narrow
 * it to the desired type automatically, which can be done by overriding
 * the <code>setUp</code> method:
 * 
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * public class MyTest extends ClientServerTestCase
 * {
 *     protected MyServer server;
 * 
 *     public void setUp() throws Exception
 *     {
 *         server = MyServerHelper.narrow ( setup.getServerObject() );
 *     }
 * 
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote><p>
 * 
 * This way, each individual test case can simply use the 
 * <code>server</code> instance variable to access the server
 * object with correct type information.
