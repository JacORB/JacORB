  JacORB/TAO ImR Integration Tests
  ===============================

This directory holds the JacORB/TAO ImR integration test suite, which is intended
 to be run manually for integration purposes.  This test suite comprises of the
following components:
   - One or more TAO ImR
   - A JacORB server application named EchoServer1 (or EchoServer2) which
basically sending back whatever message that it receives.
   - A JacOBB client application that would request services from the server
using the server's TAO ImR-ified IOR reference, which may be an IOR file, IOR
string, or a simplified corbaloc IOR string.

This test suite requires an ACE/TAO ImR release that is enhanced with supporting
features for JacORB applications.  In addition, this test suite assumes that you
are familiar with the ACE/TAO ImR usages.  Please consult the ACE/TAO literature
for information about the ACE/TAO ImR.

Building the Test Suites
-----------------------

To build the tests type:

  mvn test

This should compile the IDL and Java code that is needed to run the test.

Running the Tests
-----------------

The Bash scripts (.sh) can be invoked to setup and run the tests on a UNIX or
a LINUX platform without modification.  When invoked, the scripts will direct
all outputs to to log files in the directory "./output".  The important scripts
are:
  - run_tao_imr_locator.sh, which will initiate the TAO ImR Locator service.
  - run_tao_imr_activator.sh, which will initiate the TAO ImR Activator service.
  - run_SimpleServer.sh, run_SimpleClient.sh run_SimpleClient_ior.sh are used
    to run integration tests using the SimpleServer server whose object key is
    "/implname/EchoServer-POA/EchoServer-ID" where implname may be "EchoServer1"
    or "EchoServer2".
  - run_OnePoaServer.sh, and run_OnePoaServerClient.sh are used to run
    integration tests using the OnePoaServer server that has one child POA
    whose object key is "/implname/EchoServer-Parent-POA/EchoServer-POA/
    EchoServer-ID" where implname may be "EchoServer1" or "EchoServer2".
  - run_TwoPoaServer.sh, and run_TwoPoaClient_*.sh are used to run integration
    tests using the TwoPoaServer that has two child POAs whose object keys are
    "/implname/EchoServer-Parent-POA/EchoServer-POA1/EchoServer-ID1" and
    "/implname/EchoServer-Parent-POA/EchoServer-POA2/EchoServer-ID2".
  - run_UnknownImplName_client.sh is used to check-out the TAO ImR ability to
    to reject a request from a client using an unknown server's implname.
  - tao_imr_add_SimpleServer.sh, which will add an entry in the TAO ImR
    respository for the SimpleServer server.  This script requires two
    arguments:  implname as the first argument, which may be "EchoServer1" or
    "EchoServer2", and POA name as the second argument.
  - tao_imr_update_SimpleServer.sh, which will update the entry in the TAO ImR
    repository for the SimpleServer server.  This script requires two
    arguments:  implname as the first argument, which may be "EchoServer1" or
    "EchoServer2", and POA name as the second argument.
  - tao_imr_add_TwoPoaServer.sh, which will add an entry in the TAO ImR
    respository for the TwoPoaServer server.  This script requires two
    arguments:  implname as the first argument, which may be "EchoServer1" or
    "EchoServer2", and POA name as the second argument.
  - tao_imr_update_TwoPoaServer.sh, which will update the entry in the TAO ImR
    repository for the TwoPoaServer server.  This script requires two
    arguments:  implname as the first argument, which may be "EchoServer1" or
    "EchoServer2", and POA name as the second argument.

Before running the tests, you may wish to review the following prerequisite
steps for setting up the environment:

a) Set up the following TAO environments variables:

   - ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT
   - PATH=$PATH:$ACE_ROOT/bin
   - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib
   - DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib (needed for MACOS)

b) Set up the following JacORB environments variables:

   - JACORB_HOME
   - PATH=$PATH:$JACORB_HOME/bin
   - CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:<script-dir>/target/test-classes

c) Review the following TAO scripts to ensure that they point to the correct
   TAO executables:

     run_tao_imr_activator.sh
     run_tao_imr_locator.sh
     tao_imr_add_SimpleServer.sh
     tao_imr_update_SimpleServer.sh
     tao_imr_add_TwoPoaServer.sh
     tao_imr_update_TwoPoaServer.sh
     tao_imr.sh
     tao_cator.sh

Basic Test
----------
A basic test session would comprise of the following steps:

  - Initiate the TAO ImR Locator service by running:

        ./run_tao_imr_locator.sh

    The script will initiate the ImR service, which produces an IOR file
    "/tmp/tao_imr_locator.ior".  If you initiate the TAO ImR Locator on a remote
    system other than the one that the server application resides, then you will
    need to copy the Locator's ior file to the system where the server resides
    before initiating the server, otherwise, it will fail to find the Locator.

  - Initiate the SimpleServer server, org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.tao_imr.SimpleServer, by
    running:

        ./run_SimpleServer.sh EchoServer1

    The script will initiate a server with an implname of "EchoServer1" on the
    local host.  The server produces an ImR-ified IOR file
    "/tmp/org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.tao_imr.Server.EchoServer1.EchoServer.ior".

  - Initiate the client application, org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Client,
    by running:

        ./run_SimpleClient.sh EchoServer1

    The script will initiate the client, which will attempt to connect to the
    server through the ImR using the simplified corbaloc IOR string.  Upon
    successful, it will keep pinging the server in a loop using sequential
    messages and output the result to a log file in the directory "./output".
    You can tail the log file to follow the activities.

  - When finished, do the following to cleanup:

        - Find and kill org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Client
        - Find and kill org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.tao_imr.SimpleServer
        - Shutdown the TAO ImR Locator using:

              ./tao_imr.sh shutdown-repo

        - Remove the file /tmp/tao_imr_locator.persistent.xml

Advanced Test
-------------
An advanced test session, which involves registering the server with the TAO ImR
and auto-restarting the server by the TAO ImR Activator, would comprises of the
following steps:

  - Initiate the TAO ImR Locator service by running:

        ./run_tao_imr_locator.sh

    The script will initiate the ImR service, which produces an IOR file
    "/tmp/tao_imr_locator.ior".  If you initiate the TAO ImR Locator on a remote
    system other than the one that the server application resides, then you will
    need to copy the Locator's ior file to the system where the server resides
    before initiating the server, otherwise, it will fail to find the Locator.

  - Register the SimpleServer server having the implname of "EchoServer1" and
    the POA name of "EchoServer-POA" with the TAO ImR by running the script:

        ./run_tao_imr_add_SimpleServer.sh EchoServer1 EchoServer-POA

    Please note that, if the TAO ImR Locator has been started on a remote
    system, then you must run the script on the same system where the server
    resides.  The SimpleServer server and its implmane and POA will be
    registered as:

        JACORB:EchoServer1/EchoServer-POA

  - Verify an entry has been created for the SimpleServer server in the TAO ImR
    repository by entering:

        ./tao_imr.sh list -v

    You should see an entry with "<Server JACORB:EchoServer1/EchoServer-POA>".

  - Initiate the TAO ImR Activator service by running:

        ./run_tao_imr_activator.sh

    Again, the TAO ImR Activator must be started on the same system where the
    SimpleServer server resides.

  - Initiate the client application, org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Client,
    by running:

        ./run_SimpleClient.sh EchoServer1

    The script will initiate the client, which will attempt to connect to the
    server through the ImR using the simplified corbaloc IOR string; and as the
    result, the SimpleServer server will be started by the TAO ImR Activator.
    Upon successful connected to the server, the client application will keep
    pinging the server in a loop using sequential messages and output the
    result to a log file in the directory "./output".  You can tail the log
    file to follow the activities.

  - To test the auto-restarting of a down server, you can simulate its crashing
    by killing the SimpleServer server manually, and you should see that the
    server will be resurrected by the TAO ImR Activator.

  - When finished, do the following to cleanup:

        - Find and kill org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Client
        - Shutdown the SimpleServer server using:

              ./tao_imr.sh shutdown "JACORB:EchoServer1/EchoServer-POA"

        - Shutdown the TAO ImR Locator and Activator using:

              ./tao_imr.sh shutdown-repo -a

        - Remove the file /tmp/tao_imr_locator.persistent.xml
