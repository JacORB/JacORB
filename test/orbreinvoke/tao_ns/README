  JacORB/TAO NS Integration Tests
  ===============================

This directory holds the JacORB/TAO NS integration test suite, which is intended
 to be run manually for integration purposes.  This test suite comprises of the
following components:
   - One or more TAO NS
   - A JacORB server application named EchoServer1 (or EchoServer2) which
basically sending back whatever message that it receives.
   - A JacOBB client application that would request services from the server
using the server's TAO ImR-ified IOR reference, which may be an IOR file, IOR
string, or a simplified corbaloc IOR string.

This test suite requires a ACE/TAO NS release that is enhanced with supporting
features for JacORB applications.  In addition, this test suite assumes that you
are familiar with the ACE/TAO NS usages.  Please consult the ACE/TAO literature
for information about the ACE/TAO NS.

Building the Test Suites
-----------------------

To build the tests, type:

  mvn test

This should compile the IDL and Java code that is needed to run the test.

Running the Tests
-----------------

The Bash scripts (.sh) can be invoked to setup and run the tests on a UNIX or
a LINUX platform without modification.  When invoked, the scripts will direct
all outputs to to log files in the directory "./output".  The important scripts
are:

  - run_tao_ns.sh, which will initiate the TAO NS service.
  - run_server.sh, which will initiate the server org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.tao_ns.Server.
  - run_client.sh, which will initiate the client org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corba.Client.

Before running the tests, you may wish to review the following prerequisite
steps for setting up the environment:

a) Set up the following TAO environments variables:

   - ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT
   - PATH=$PATH:$ACE_ROOT/bin
   - LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib
   - DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib (needed for MACOS)

b) Set up the following JacORB environments variables:

   - JACORB_HOME
   - PATH=$PATH:$JACORB_HOME/bin
   - CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:<script-dir>/target/test-classes

c) Review the following TAO script to ensure that they point to the correct
   TAO executable:

     run_tao_ns.sh

A basic test session would comprise of the following steps:

  - Start the TAO NS Locator service by running:

        ./run_tao_ns.sh

    The script will initiate the TAO NS service, which produces an IOR file
    "/tmp/myTaoNs.ior".  If you initiate the TAO NS on a remote host, then you
    need to copy the IOR file from the remote host to the host where the server
    resides before initiating the server.

  - Initiate the server, org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.tao_ns.Server, by
    running:

        ./run_server.sh EchoServer1

    The script will initiate a server with an implname of "EchoServer1", which
    uses the NS's IOR file to contact the NS service, and produces the IOR file
    "/tmp/org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.tao_ns.Server.EchoServer1.ior".

  - Initiate the client application, org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Client,
    by running:

        ./run_client.sh EchoServer1

    The script will initiate the client, which will request services from the
    server through the NS using the simplified corbaname (not a corbaloc) IOR
    string.  Upon successful, it will keep pinging the server in a loop using
    sequential messages and output the result to a log file in the directory
    "./output".  You can tail the log file to follow the activities.
