  JacORB ImR Integration Tests
  ===============================

This directory holds the JacORB ImR integration test suite, which is intended
 to be run manually for integration purposes.

Building the Test Suites
-----------------------

To build the tests type "mvn test"

This should compile the IDL and Java code that is needed to run the test.

Running the Tests
-----------------

The Bash scripts (.sh) can be invoked to setup and run the tests on a UNIX or
a LINUX platform.  When invoked, the scripts will direct all outputs to to log
files in the directory "./output".  The important scripts are:
  - run_imr.sh, which will initiate the JacORB ImR server.
  - run_server.sh, which takes an argument for the server's implname, which may
    be either "EchoServer1" or "EchoServer2".  The object key will have the
    following format: "implname/implname-POA/implname-ID".
  - run_client.sh, which takes an argument for the targeted server's implname,
    which may be "EchoServer1" or "EchoServer2".  This script will initiate
    the client application using an ImR-ified corbaloc string to request
    service from the server.
  - run_two_imr_client.sh, which will initiate a client application as
    similar to the script "run_client.sh".  However, unlike the script
    "run_client.sh", the ImR-ified simplified corbaloc string used in this script
    specifies endpoints for two ImR servers.  Before running this script, you
    need to have at least one ImR service along with a server running.
  - run_direct_client.sh, which will initiate a client application using a
    server's direct endpoint.
  - run_imr_ssd.sh, which is a wrapper script to initiate the ImR SSD service.
  - run_imr_mg.sh, which is a wrapper script to run the ImR Manager service.

A basic test session would comprise of the following steps:
  - Start the ImR service by running:
        ./run_imr.sh
    The script will initiate the ImR service, which produces an IOR file
    "/tmp/MyImR.ior".
  - Initiate the server application, org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.jacorb_imr.Server,
    by running:
        ./run_server.sh EchoServer1
    The script will initiate a server with an implname of "EchoServer1", which
    produces an ImR-ified IOR file "/tmp/org.jacorb.test.orbreinvoke.jacorb_imr.Server.EchoServer1.
    EchoServer.ior".
  - Initiate the client application, org.jacorb.test.listenendpoints.echo_corbaloc.Client,
    by running:
        ./run_client.sh EchoServer1
    The script will initiate the client, which will attempt to connect to the
    server using an simplfied corbaloc ImR-ified IOR string.  Upon successful
    connected to the server, it will keep pinging the server in a permanent loop
    using sequential messages and output the result to a log file in the
    "./output" directory.  You can tail the log file to follow the activity.
