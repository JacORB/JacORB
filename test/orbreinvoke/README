  JacORB ORB-revinvoke Integration Tests
  ===============================

This directory holds the JacORB and TAO ImplementationRepository (ImR) and
TAO Naming Service (NS) integration test suites, which are intended to be
run manually for integration purposes.  The tests are kept in their respective
directories as follows:
   - jacorb_imr, which contains the integration tests to check-out the
operational functions between the JacORB ImR and JacORB applications.
   - tao_imr, which contains the integration tests to check-out the operational
functions between the TAO ImR and the JacORB
applications.
   - tao_ns, which contains the integration tests to check-out the operational
functions between the TAO NS and the JacORB
applications.

Please note that in order to use the test suites in the directories tao_imr,
you will need a ACE/TAO ImR version that is enhanced with the capability to
support the JacORB applications.

Building the Test Suites
-----------------------

There is a pom.xml file in each test directory.  To build the tests type :

  mvn test

This should compile the IDL and Java code that is needed to run the test.
Please note that these test suites borrow the classes that were developed
for the listenendpoints tests (package org.test.listenendpoints).

Running the Tests
-----------------

There are simple Bash Shell scripts in each test directory to help with running
the tests, and they are named intuitive for their functionalities.  They are
designed to run from the commandline prompt and can be run on a UNIX/LINUX
system, and they can be easily adapted for other platforms.  Before using
the scripts, you might wish to review them to ensure that they are compatible
with your testing environment.  Please note that to run the tests in the
directories tao_imr and tao_ns, you will need to set the TAO environment
variables ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT in addtion to setting the JACORB_HOME.
The scripts will redirect test outputs to log files that are kept under the
relative directory "./output".
