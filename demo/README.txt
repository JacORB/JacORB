JacORB Demonstration Examples
=============================


This file gives a quick overview of the supplied demo code. The majority of the examples
(except where specified) may be compiled and run by running ant in the respective directory.

AMI
This example demonstrates Asynchronous Message Invocation.

Any
This example demonstrates passing parameters inside an Any.

Arrays
This example demonstrates passing arrays of various types as parameters.

Benchmark
This example is an very simple benchmark for remote invocations.

BiDir
This example demonstrates the use of bidir communications.

Corbaloc
This example demonstrates using corbaloc initial references.

DII
This example shows how to create and handle Dynamic Interface Invocations.

DynAny
This example shows how to ue DynamicAny objects.

Grid
This example demonstrates using BigDecimal numbers in a 2D array and throwing user exceptions.

Hello
This is the classic hello world example.

Interceptors
This example demonstrates a simple use of portable interceptors.

MIOP
This example demonstrates using a MIOP transport.

MtClient
This is a simple example that simulates multiple clients sending concurrent
requests to the server. It also demonstrates the use of oneway methods to
track which thread has been updated.

Outparam
This example demonstrates using out parameters.

Policies
This example demonstrates using CORBA QoS Policies

SSL
This example demonstrates using a client/server with SSL.

Unions
This example demonstrates using unions

Value
This example demonstrates using valuetypes.


The following examples are not fully automated (e.g. they require an IMR to be started).

Bank & Concurrent
Examples to demonstrate concurrency and transaction service.

IMR
This example demonstrates using an Implementation Repository.

SAS
This example demonstrates using the Secure Attribute Service (SAS).

Notification & Event
Examples are supplied to demonstrate using the Notification & Event Service.

Maven
This example is based on the Hello example but utilises Maven for dependencies and compilation.
