        --------------------

The purpose of this demo is to show the use of the Secure Attribute
Service (SAS).

There are two versions of the demo; one a simple version that passes credentials,
a second that requires a valid Kerberos configuration. For the second, a valid
principal, username, and password must be passed.

To compile and run
   mvn install

To run the Kerberos demo
   mvn install -Pkerberos-demo -Dprincipal=xxx@XXX.COM -Dusername=xxx -Dpassword=xxx
