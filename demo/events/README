JacORB 0.8

			Event service example
			=====================


This demo is a simple example of using the event service. (A
more interesting example would be to implement the card game
example using the event service.)

Basically, there are two modes for both suppliers and consumers 
of events: "push" and "pull" mode.

Consumers of events can either register as "push"-consumers, 
i.e. they will receive events whenever the event channel thinks 
it appropriate, e.g. as soon as events are available.

In "pull"-mode, consumers will explicitly receive events by 
calling the pull-operation. This operation will block if no 
events are available. Alternatively, consumers can use the 
"try_pull" operation to check for events without blocking.

Suppliers of events can actively provide events to the 
channel by calling the push operation. In pull mode, 
the event channel would "pull" events from the suppliers.

This directory contains a server program "channelServer" which 
creates an event channel object. There is one test program for 
every supported mode, i.e. push consumer, pull consumer and push 
supplier. Since the Suppliers and Consumers do not unregister 
properly, you might have to restart the event channel after 
terminating a supplier or consumer.

Let me point out that the JacORB event service implementation is
only a prototype which serves to demonstrate how the event service 
works. It is _not_ production quality (but you might use
it as a starting point).
