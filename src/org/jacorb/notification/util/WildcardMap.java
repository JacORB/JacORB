/**
 * An Object that maps String Keys to Values.<br> 
 * A WildcardMap cannot contain duplicate keys.
 * Each Key has exactly one Entry associated. A Key can contain the Wildcard Character '*' which
 * matches zero or more characters. The WildcardMap supports two semantics of accessing
 * the entries. The first way is to ignore the special meaning of the Wildcard character and to just
 * return the entries as they were inserted. <br>
 * This way you could put some entries in a WildcardMap and fetch them again using the Operation
 * {@link #getNoExpansion(Object) getNoExpansion()}:
 * 
 * <pre> 
 *   WildcardMap wc = new WildcardMap();
 *   wc.put(&quot;abc&quot;, new Integer(1));
 *   wc.put(&quot;a*&quot;, new Integer(2));
 *   wc.getNoExpansion(&quot;abc&quot;) =&gt; 1
 *   wc.getNoExpansion(&quot;a*&quot;) =&gt; 2
 *   wc.getNoExpansion(&quot;xyz&quot;) =&gt; null
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This behaviour is similiar to a {@link java.util.Map Map}.<br>
 * The other way using the WildcardMap is to use the Operation {@link #getWithExpansion(Object)
 * getWithExpansion()}. This Operations matches the requested Key to all contained Keys. If the Key
 * of an Entry contains the Wildcard Character '*' it is matched as expected by the semantic of '*'.
 * The Operations returns an array of all matching entries:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   wc.getWithExpansion(&quot;abc&quot;) =&gt; [1,2]
 *   wc.getWithExpansion(&quot;a&quot;) =&gt; [2]
 *   wc.getWithExpansion(&quot;abcd&quot;) =&gt; [2]
 *   wc.getWithExpansion(&quot;xyz&quot;) =&gt; []
 * </pre>
