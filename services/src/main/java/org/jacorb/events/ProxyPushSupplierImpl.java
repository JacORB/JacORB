/**
 * Implementation of COSEventChannelAdmin interface; ProxyPushSupplier.

 *
 * 2002/23/08 JFC OMG EventService Specification 1.1 page 2-7 states:
 *      "Registration is a two step process.  An event-generating application
 *      first obtains a proxy consumer from a channel, then 'connects' to the
 *      proxy consumer by providing it with a supplier.  ...  The reason for

 *    section 2.1.5 "Disconnection Behavior" on page 2-4.
