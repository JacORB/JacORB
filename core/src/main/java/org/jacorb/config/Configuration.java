/**
 * ORB configuration objects are read-only representations of files with
 * configuration properties.
 *
 * ORB configuration options for a given name are looked up and loaded as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>System properties are loaded first, but only to get properties
 *     that affect further property loading
 * <li>the file <tt>orb.properties</tt> is loaded from java.home/lib
 *     and user.home if it exists
 * <li>if the ORBid is property is set, the file <tt>ORBid.properties</tt> is
 *     loaded from jacorb.config.dir/etc, if that exists, or jacorb.home/etc, or '.'
 *     If ORBid is not set, the default file <tt>jacorb.properties</tt>
 *     is loaded from these places.
 * <li>Custom properties are loaded from each file name listed int the system property
 *     <tt>custom.props</tt>
 * <li>To also support packaged servers in jar files, the configuration
 *     file lookup mechanism finally tries to load named properties files
 *     (<tt>ORBid.properties</tt>, or <tt>jacorb.properties</tt>) from
 *     the classpath, if it cannot find them in the config dictionary.
 * <li> After all property files have been loaded, the System properties are
 *      loaded again, so that command-line properties take precedence
 * <li> Finally, properties hard-coded and passed in through ORB.init() are
 *      loaded.
 *</ol>
 *
 * The Configuration object is also used by JacORB components to
 * retreive their Logger objects.
