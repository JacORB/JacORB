/**
 * The purpose of the ListenEndpoint class is to hold a set of two endpoint
 * address and sslAddress, and other informations that are
 * relevant to the endpoint.  Upon being initiated, the TransportManager will
 * create a list of default ListenEndpoint objects for the endpoints that are
 * specified by the network properties OAAddress, OASSLAddress, OASSLPort,
 * OAPort and OAIAddr, and it will create an overriding list of endpoints that
 * are specified by the command-line -ORBListendEndpints argument.  The
 * TransportManager will then store the ListenEndpoint objects which will
 * be used by BasicAdapter to update the listeners for the assigned ListenEndpoint
 * object.
